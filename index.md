## If you work at Mailchimp

This guide is a fork of Mailchimp's company style guide. The goal is for Mailchimp content creators to write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you're writing for Mailchimp.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It’s not traditional in format or content. We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.

## If you work on caught my eye projects

There are now three high-level categories to further organise the original Mailchimp guide. These categories are named foundations, writing, and references.

Some projects, such as the Uncanny Owl blog, will have grammar rules that conflict with Mailchimp's style. These special rules are added to this guide instead of overwriting the original rule.

## If you work at another organization

_caught my eye_ invites you to use and adapt this style guide as you see fit. It’s completely public and available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license. All we ask is that you credit Mailchimp can caught my eye as appropriate.
