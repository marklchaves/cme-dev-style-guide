## Impromptu Style Guide 

This impromptu style guide was reverse engineered using the [How to Set Up Custom Dimensions](https://www.monsterinsights.com/docs/how-do-i-set-up-custom-dimensions/) document as an example.

- The intro section should have a prerequisites section.
- H2s are title case.
- Numbered steps are H2s and are prefaced with the word "Step" followed by a number and colon. E.g., Step 1: Do This Now
- H2 _step_ titles start with a verb.
- Sub steps are not numbered.
- Navigation breadcrumbs are delimited by 2 _greater than_ symbols (>>)
- Screen captures are 1080px wide.
- The red arrow graphics are [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vykytcns9hklvyu/AAD0aU8qAQE_EWbyWE4DxLyJa?dl=0).
- There's **no** summary or conclusion section. Instead of a summary or conclusion there's a _nudge_ CTA to read a recommended post/doc. E.g.:

<blockquote>
